The essential parts of his propositions are set forth with all the clearness imaginable, and his reasoning explained and placed in so advantageous a light, that the eye the least attentive may perceive it. To render these elements still more easy, the different operations and arguments essential to a good demonstration, are distinguished in several separate articles. First. The preparation and demonstration are distinguished from each other. Secondly. The proposition being set down, what is supposed in the proposition, is made known, under the title of hypothesis, and what is affirmed, under that of Thesis. Thirdly. All the operations necessary to make known truths serve as a proof to an unknown one, are ranged in separate articles. Fourthly. The foundation of each proposition, relative to the figure, which forms the minor of the argument, is made known by citations; and a marginal citation recalls the truths already demonstrated, which is the major. In one word, nothing is omitted which may fix the attention of beginners, make them perceive the chain, and teach them to follow the thread of geometrical reasoning.
